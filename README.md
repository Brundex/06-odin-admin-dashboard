Welcome! 

This is the last project for the Intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project - Fullstack Javascript Course. I used this project as a repository site for all the projects I've been working on so far. Some of them will have poor code due to a lack of experience at the time, but I am actively updating them to apply the techniques I learn along the way.

Feel free to check the projects I worked on. You will also find a button to see the repository on GitHub.

Thanks for passing by!

Bruno
